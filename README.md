# geo-construction-prover
A prover for a subset of coherent logic where implications have conjunctions of atomic formulas on both sides, without disjunctions or existential quantifiers. 
Designed to verify the correctness of geometric constructions. Made for ArgoTriCS, a program that generates triangle constructions based on given points.
